# Temporal_Cyclic-attention
This code is codes used for paper "Attention Mechanism for Lithium-Ion Battery Lifespan Prediction: Temporal and Cyclic Attention."

Codes for RNN-TA-1D CNN, RNN-CA-1D CNN, RNN-TA-CA-1D CNN are prepared to predict knee-onset of cells from Severson dataset.
Additionally, input reduction test codes for each and all batches with RNN-TA-CA-1D CNN are prepared as suggested in our paper.
