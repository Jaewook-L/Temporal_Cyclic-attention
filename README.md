# Temporal_Cyclic-attention
This code is codes used for paper "Extracting Key Temporal and Cyclic Features from VIT Data to Predict Lithium-Ion Battery Knee Points Using Attention Mechanisms."(Computers & Chemical Engineering, https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135424003491)

Codes for RNN-TA-1D CNN, RNN-CA-1D CNN, RNN-TA-CA-1D CNN are prepared to predict knee-onset of cells from Severson dataset.
Additionally, input reduction test codes for each and all batches with RNN-TA-CA-1D CNN are prepared as suggested in our paper.
Codes for temporal, cyclic attention score plots are also provided for user's comfort.
