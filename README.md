# Temporal_Cyclic-attention
This code is codes used for paper "Attention Mechanism for Lithium-Ion Battery Lifespan Prediction: Temporal and Cyclic Attention."

Codes for RNN-TA-1D CNN, RNN-CA-1D CNN, RNN-TA-CA-1D CNN are prepared to predict knee-onset of cells from Severson dataset.
Additionally, input reduction test codes for each and all batches with RNN-TA-CA-1D CNN are prepared as suggested in our paper.
Codes for temporal, cyclic attention score plots are also provided for user's comfort.

Datasets used in this codes can be downloaded in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18AcIaegpfY10Y42gNNUxuIZ9wcugcDXm?usp=sharing.
